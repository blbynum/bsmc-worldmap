# Bible Study MC Worldmap

## Importing the map

1. Download this repo
2. Open FtbApp.
3. Hover over FTB Revelation and click "More".
4. Click the orange "Open Folder" button in the top-right. This should open a folder in Explorer (Windows) or Finder (Mac).
5. Within that folder, navigate to `journeymap>data>mp`.
6. In this folder, you should see a folder with the name you gave to the server (i.e. `Bible~Study~Minecraft`). Navigate to that folder.
7. There should be two folders: `DIM0` and `waypoints`. Delete them (unless you are overwriting your existing map for this server, then keep waypoints). 
8. Unzip the contents of `BibleStudyServer_JourneyMap.zip` into this directory. If it creates a folder called `BibleStudyServer_JourneyMap` that contains the `DIM0` folder, copy it out into the `Bible~Study~Minecraft` (or whatever your directory is called from step 6) folder and delete the `BibleStudyServer_JourneyMap` folder . When your done, your folder structure should look like the image below, with the highlighted folder being the name you gave the server.
